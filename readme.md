# Million Song Dataset for singer information retrieval

The dataset is created by performing singing voice detection on the Million Song Dataset (MSD) and collecting singers with at least 15 songs with more than 70% singing sections. 

SVD code used is from [https://github.com/keums/SingingVoiceDetection](https://github.com/keums/SingingVoiceDetection)


### Singer classification models 
I have also trained several singer classification models with this dataset and have included the weights in this repo.
* In popular music, singer classification is very similar to artist classification, since most singers have consistent music style.

# simple dnn model
# siamese model 
# source separated track model 
```
